Create App in Developer Portal
=================================

Much like with other app stores, in order to test and deploy an Alexa skill, a
skill needs to be created in the `Amazon Developer`_ portal. This provide your
Alexa enabled device with the information concerning the phrase that triggers
your skill and also where to send the request data once your skill is invoked.


Navigating the Developer Portal
===============================

Once you log in to the `Amazon Developer`_ portal, click on the "Alexa" tab. On
the next page, click on "Get Started" button for the "Alexa Skills Kit". This
page will keep a list of all of the skills that you have created with your
account. To get started, click on the "New Skill" button.


Skill Information
=================

Feel free to keep all of the defaults on this page, but be sure to give your
skill a "Name" and an "Invocation Name". The name of the skill is what users
will see in the skill store and when your skill gives your users information
cards. The invocation name is the phrase users will say in order to use your
skill such as "Alexa, tell recipe helper I need help making scrambled eggs." In
this phrase, "recipe helper" is the invocation name of the skill.
